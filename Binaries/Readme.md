#Pre-compiled binaries for standard situations

This is the folder for ready compiled binaries in several standard versions.
The binaries must be patched to the user's credentials using the provided PythonPatcher.py script.
The PythonPatcher is another porject of mine here: https://github.com/rin67630/ESP_Binary_patcher
Once patched, the script can upload the patched binary to your blank ESP8266 device, which will then automatically know the WiFi credentials and the credentials to a cloud service (here thinger.io).
Get your devie up and running including cloud dashboards at a breeze!
